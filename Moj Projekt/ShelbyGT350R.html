				<h3>Shelby GT350R</h3>
				<h4>Concept</h4>
				<p>Based on the 2015 Ford Mustang GT350, the GT350R takes it up one more notch for track-day enthusiasts by bringing more racing oriented parts.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"The Shelby GT350R Mustang is a no-compromise car in the pursuit of maximum track capability," said Raj Nair, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development. "It is a thoroughbred street car making use of technology and ingenuity to deliver performance few enthusiasts have ever experienced."</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Production</h4>
				<p>The exterior is improved through a front lower air splitter, a rear difusser, vented hood for heat extraction and lift reduction, underbody belly pans, vented wheel wells, different side skirts as well as a rear wing. The deletion of the air conditioning system stereo, rear seats, trunk floorboard and carpet, backup camera, exhaust resonators and the extensive use of carbon fiber makes the car a lot lighter than the standard GT350.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The car features the first-ever production V8 from Ford with a flat-plane crankshaft - the most powerful naturally aspirated engine Ford has ever produced - plus a specially tuned suspension. It is fitted with revised spring rates and antiroll bars, lower ride height, unique track-tuned alignment settings, revised bushings and jounce bumpers, cross-axis ball joints in the front suspension, and revised calibration controlling the MagneRide dampers.
                </p>
		
				<br><p>"The Shelby GT350R Mustang is a car with the nimbleness and power delivery you want on a road course," said Nair. "This isn't just about horsepower. The Shelby GT350R is an all-around balanced athlete - one that is extraordinarily precise and agile."</p>
