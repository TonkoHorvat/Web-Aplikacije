    <p>Ford Mustang 's pony car brand <b>Ford</b> and products of 1964 , the Mustang was Ford's best-selling new model since the Model A . The Mustang is one of Ford’s oldest models still in production, currently in its fifth generation. The Mustang created the "pony car" class of cars, so competitors such as the Camaro , AMC Javelin and Chrysler's Barracuda soon arrived.
	<br><br>The <b>Mustang GT</b> didn’t start as a model, but as a $165 package that included disc brakes, dual exhaust, driving lights in the grille, badges, rocker panel racing stripes inspired by GT40, and a full gauge cluster instead of idiot lights. It also came with the equipment from the Special Handling package, which included stiffer springs, heavy-duty shocks, a 13/16-inch sway bar, and a quicker steering box. It was only available for 4-barrel versions of the 289-cubic-inch V-8, which made 225 or 271 hp. The package was not available for the early cars referred to as 1964 ½ models. For the 1966 model year, it was only offered on the hi-po 271-hp engine, but it was available for all V-8s in 1967.
